# fontello-update bug demonstration

There are two files:

- fontello-original.zip
- fontello-repacked.zip

The first is the original file that was downloaded from the [fontello's website](http://fontello.com/).
The other one was created by unzipping the first file and re-zipping with a native OSX compression app.
